# Coding Quiz

## Description

I have created this coding quiz for students who wish to test themselves on information that covers topics such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although simplistic and quite short, the code reflects a program that is ble to modified and eventually have more questions added while still retaining is functionalities.
